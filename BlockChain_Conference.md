1. [Network] Modeling the Impact of Network Connectivity on Consensus Security of Proof-of-Work Blockchain (InfoCom)
   - Proposing a novel **analytical model** to assess the impact of **network connectivity** on the **security** of PoW-based blockchain consensus systems. 
2. [off-chain] Secure Balance Planning of Off-blockchain Payment Channel Networks (InfoCom)
   - Instead of struggling with consensus mechanism design, payment channels have been proposed to address the scalability challenge by creating a private channel between two blockchain nodes. 
   - A critical challenge in payment network construction is to decide **how many funds should be deposited into payment channels as initial balances**, which seriously **influences the performance of payment networks**, but has been seldom studied by existing work. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing PnP, a balance planning service for payment networks.
